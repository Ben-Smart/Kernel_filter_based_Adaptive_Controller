# Kernel_filter_based_Adaptive_Controller
Cybergenetics integrates control theory with biological systems to regulate gene expression and cell behavior. Low sampling rates impair model accuracy, but a proposed kernel filter adapts parameters online for better predictions. In silico tests show it outperforms particle filters in controlling gene network oscillators.
